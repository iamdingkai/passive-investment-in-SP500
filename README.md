# passive-investment-in-SP500

This code evaluates a naive investment strategy: 
The investor has daily income of $1. The investor uses a simple investment strategy: when SP500 dips x%, they invest y% of their cumulative saving.

What would be x and y that can maximize investment return? 
I use historical data of SP500 index to answer this question. 

Result:
Better not to time the market. SP500 has an annual return of 8.5%. At this speed, a wait-and-get-in strategy can easily miss the fast trend and under-perform a simple strategy of fixed invsetment every day/month.
